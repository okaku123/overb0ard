**iOS and macOS share a program: jetsam.** The tl;dr is that jetsam monitors memory usage, asks for memory when there isn't much free, and kills other programs that don't give back as much as was requested. This tool--a continuation from conradev's jetsamctl--serves to override the strict limits that jetsam sets on iOS devices with a simple command. All you need is a device with iOS 7 or later.

### Usage

Type `jetsamctl` in a terminal to learn more about how to use. Here's some examples of what you can do:

Limit the Phone app to 48 MB of memory: 
```
jetsamctl -l 48 MobilePhone
```

Set the priority of the Photos app to that of an iOS keyboard extension: 
```
jetsamctl -p 8 MobileSlideShow
```

### Priorities

Here is a table of all of the priorities and their numerical values. A lower priority value obviously means that jetsam will bother it more.

| Priority | Value | Examples |
|:--|:--:|:--:|
| Idle Head | -2 | |
| Default | -1 | |
| Idle | 0 | |
| Idle (Deferred) | 1 | |
| Background (Opportunistic) | 2 | |
| Background | 3 | |
| Mail | 4 | Apple Mail |
| Phone | 5 | Phone app |
| UI Support | 8 | Keyboard extension |
| Foreground Support | 90 | Share extension |
| Foreground | 10 | Foreground application |
| Audio and Accessory | 12 | |
| Conductor | 13 | |
| Home | 16 | SpringBoard |
| Executive | 17 | |
| Important | 18 | |
| Critical | 19 | |
| Maximum | 21 | |

Since iOS 16, all non-negative priorities has been multiplied by 10, so on iOS 16, the priority for SpringBoard is 160.
